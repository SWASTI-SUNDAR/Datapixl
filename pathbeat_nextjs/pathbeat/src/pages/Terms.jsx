        By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the processing,

        Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration
      </h4>

      <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
        Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
        arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Pathbeat and limits the
        manner in which you can seek relief from us.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
        Except for small claims disputes in which you or Pathbeat seek to bring
        an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your
        billing address or disputes in which you or Pathbeat seeks injunctive or
        other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual
        property, you and Pathbeat waive your rights to a jury trial and to have
        any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services
        resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to
        these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential
        binding arbitration held in appropriate Indian territory.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
        You and Pathbeat agree that any dispute arising out of or related to
        these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Pathbeat and that any
        dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will
        not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
        representative proceeding.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
        ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES MUST
        BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS
        PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND PATHBEAT WILL NOT HAVE THE
        RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
        You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30)
        days of the date you first accepted the terms of this paragraph by
        emailing us at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:webmaster@pathbeat.in">contact@pathbeat.in</a> In order
        to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and
        clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By
        opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes
        in accordance with the Governing Law section of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h4 className="mt-4 mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Governing Law</h4>

      <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
        These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
        with the laws of the Indian state, without resort to its conflict of law
        provisions. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and
        submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit,
        action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h4 className="mt-4 mb-4 text-xl font-bold">General</h4>

      <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
        Enforcement of these Terms is solely at Pathbeat&#8217;s discretion.
        Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not
        constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of
        these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or
        becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable, then that provision
        will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
        closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining
        provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. We
        reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to
        terminate your right to access or use our Services. We are not
        responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or
        use our Services.
